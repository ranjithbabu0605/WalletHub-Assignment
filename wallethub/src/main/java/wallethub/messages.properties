Review=Sterling Bank, formerly Sterling Savings Bank, has been there for every step of my financial life. I began using them at 14, when I created a checking and savings account to deposit checks from lawn mowing jobs. They have made a substantial impact on my life, I will list three top qualities for how they have done this. The first being presentation, at every branch you will be hard pressed to find a cleaner location, inside as well as out. This extends to their employees as well for always have the highest degree of hygiene and professionalism. Such attention to detail translates to there business, and I have never not once in ten years of being a customer had a single problem, error, or identity theft. Secondly, the rates they offer are amazing, having two accounts with them I never was charged a penny for the service, and the checking account includes personalized checks, all for free. For someone like me who just needs an account for direct deposit or transferring from Paypal, they have been the ideal option, and I have used national banks such as bank of america as well, they all have hidden fees that if requirements are not met you will be charged a certain amount every month. Finally one of the top attributes of this company, their speed of service! You better be ready when you head to sterling because
they know you have busy schedules and breaks that are ending and somehow manage to deliver professional courtesy while conducting business in the speediest way possible. There are many other reasons that I would recommend this bank, the three I have listed should give a good idea that your money is well placed in their hands. I would recommend opening both savings and checking accounts at this bank.
